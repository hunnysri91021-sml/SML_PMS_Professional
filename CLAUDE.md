# SML PMS — Project Notes for Claude

Single-file HTML/CSS/vanilla-JS Performance Management System (`SML_PMS_v14.html`).
No build step, no framework. Deployed via GitHub Pages from `main`
(`index.html` redirects to `SML_PMS_v14.html`). Feature work also mirrors
onto `claude/sharp-wozniak-03hehj` — keep both branches in sync after every
push (`git checkout main && git merge <feature-branch> --no-edit && git push`,
then switch back).

## Recurring mistakes found in this codebase — check for these before shipping

Every item below was a real bug found and fixed in production code, not a
hypothetical. Re-check for the same shape of mistake in any new feature that
touches employee/attendance/evaluation data.

1. **Never trust a name/label that came from a file, form, or another
   record — always resolve identity by code against `MASTER_USERS`.**
   `importHrgoFile()` used to store whatever name was in the uploaded CSV's
   `full_name` column, and `renderAttendanceList()` then preferred that
   stored name over a live `MASTER_USERS` lookup. Fix: always look up
   `MASTER_USERS.find(u => u[0] === code)` and use `emp[1]` as the name;
   only fall back to a stored/file name if no matching employee exists at
   all, and even then treat it as a warning-worthy edge case, not silently.
   Apply this same rule to any future field that "denormalizes" employee
   data into another record (position, department, etc.) — resolve from
   the master record at render/save time, don't trust a copy.

2. **A code that doesn't exist in `MASTER_USERS` should be rejected/skipped
   and reported, never silently accepted.** `importHrgoFile()` and
   `saveManualAttendance()` both now check `MASTER_USERS.find(...)` before
   writing to `ATTENDANCE` and refuse (with a clear toast, and for bulk
   import, a list of skipped codes) rather than creating a record for a
   nonexistent employee.

3. **Any filter/dropdown of real data must be populated from the actual
   dataset, never hand-written as static `<option>`s.** Found twice: the
   user-list filters (`filterGroup`/`filterSection`) and the org-chart page
   filter all had 2-3 hardcoded options that happened to match the demo
   data by coincidence — a new group/department added via the UI or an
   MS365 sync would be unfilterable. Fix pattern: a `populate*Filters()`
   function that rebuilds `<option>`s from `[...new Set(MASTER_USERS.map(u
   => u[idx]))]`, called on initial load AND after every place that can
   change `MASTER_USERS` (`saveUserFromModal()`, `loadEmployeesFromMs365()`).
   When adding a new filterable field, wire it into the same populate
   function rather than writing static options.

4. **Every `<select>`/`<input>` that's meant to filter or act on something
   needs a real `id` and a real event handler.** The org-chart page's
   department filter and search box had neither — clicking/typing did
   nothing. When adding a control, verify with a headless-browser click
   test that it actually changes rendered output, not just that it exists
   in the DOM.

5. **Positional array indices are load-bearing — double check them, and
   only ever append new fields at the end.** `MASTER_USERS` rows and
   `SML_FORMS[level].factors` are plain arrays indexed positionally
   (`u[6]` = department, `f[2]` = weight, etc.). A prior bug read `f[1]`
   instead of `f[2]` for weight and broke scoring silently. When adding a
   new field to any of these arrays, append at the end (see how `startDate`
   was added as index 14) — never insert in the middle, and grep for every
   place that reads that array by index before changing its shape.

6. **`localStorage`-backed "override merged over hardcoded default" values
   need a reset path**, because a value saved once by a user persists
   forever and will silently keep overriding a later code fix (this is
   exactly what happened after the MS365 Tenant ID/Client ID swap was
   fixed in code but stayed wrong in anyone's already-saved config).
   Every such store (`MS365_CONFIG_KEY`, `NAV_PERMS_KEY`,
   `SML_FORMS_STORAGE_KEY`, ...) has a `reset*ToDefault()` function and a
   visible button — add both for any new persisted-override value.

7. **A local queue that's pushed to an external system (Excel via Graph)
   must actually shrink after a successful push.** `ms365PushAppraisals()`
   used to leave every draft in `MS365_LOCAL_DRAFT_KEY` forever after
   pushing, so a repeat push would re-send the same rows to Excel
   indefinitely. Any "queue → push to remote → done" flow must persist the
   queue with successfully-pushed items removed (keep only failures) as
   part of the same operation, not as an afterthought.

8. **This app has no real backend — `localStorage` is per-browser/device.**
   Anything that looks like "notify other users" or "everyone sees the
   same status" needs to go through the one channel that actually is
   shared: the MS365/SharePoint Excel file via Graph API. A `localStorage`
   value can only ever describe "what happened on this device." When
   asked for cross-device visibility, either (a) write it to a real Excel
   table via `graphAddTableRow` and read it back with a **silent-only**
   token acquisition (never `loginPopup`/`acquireTokenPopup` in a read
   path — that would interrupt people who never asked to log in), or (b)
   be explicit that the feature is local-only.

9. **An "✏️ แก้ไข" (edit) button must actually load the record's current
   data into the form — never just open the same blank Add modal.** Found
   on the employee list and employee detail view: `openM('mAddUser')`
   opened an empty form regardless of which row was clicked, so editing
   (and using any newly-added field) was impossible for existing records.
   Fix pattern: a dedicated `openEditRecord(id)` that looks the record up,
   sets every field's `.value` explicitly (including re-running any
   cascading dropdowns and converting stored date formats back to the
   `<input type="date">` format), and disables the identity/key field so
   it can't accidentally be edited into a different record. Any "+ เพิ่ม"
   (add-new) entry point must call a `clear*Form()` first so leftover
   edit-mode state (a disabled ID field, a stale value) can't leak in.

10. **A button that closes a modal and shows an `alert()`/toast claiming
    success, with no underlying data or transport backing it, is not a
    feature — it's a placeholder that will eventually be reported as
    broken.** The "ส่ง Reminder" modal had a hardcoded "47 คน" target
    count and channel checkboxes with no wiring at all behind them. When
    building something like this in a static, backend-less app: compute
    the target list live from `MASTER_USERS` (or whatever real store
    applies), and for the action itself, only offer channels that can
    actually work without a server — e.g. a `mailto:` link is honest and
    works; a fake "sent via LINE/in-app notification" is not, and should
    be visibly disabled with a one-line reason instead.

11. **A multi-stage approval/workflow page (Review → Calibration → Approve,
    or anything shaped like it) needs one real status field driving all of
    them — never separate hardcoded tables per stage.** All three pages
    were static sample HTML with independent fake counts that could never
    agree with each other. Fix pattern: one shared store (here, the
    evaluation draft queue, `MS365_LOCAL_DRAFT_KEY`) carries a `status`
    field with an explicit linear set of values; each stage's page is a
    filtered view of that same store (`d[status]==='Submitted'`, etc.),
    and its actions (`getCheckedKeys` + `updateDraftStatus`) mutate that
    one field. This also means: before adding a new terminal state (like
    `Approved`), re-check every place that already reads that store
    unconditionally (e.g. `ms365PushAppraisals()` used to push every
    draft regardless of stage — it must filter to the terminal status) and
    every place computing "has this person submitted yet" (`
    getReminderTargets()` — must treat every non-`Draft` status as
    submitted, not just the literal string `'Submitted'`).
12. **A "queue key" (`empCode|cycle|level` here) must be deduplicated on
    write, not just on push.** `saveEvaluationLocal()` used to `unshift` a
    new entry on every save, so re-saving the same person/cycle/level
    silently piled up duplicate rows instead of updating the existing one
    — the same shape of bug as CLAUDE.md #7, just one step earlier in the
    pipeline. Any "save/submit this record" function needs to filter out
    the existing entry with the same natural key before adding the new one.

## Verification checklist for any change to this file

Before considering a change to `SML_PMS_v14.html` done:

- `node --check` / `new Function(scriptBlock)` syntax validation (see any
  recent commit for the one-liner).
- Serve locally (`python3 -m http.server 8794`) and drive it with headless
  Chromium (Playwright, `executablePath: '/opt/pw-browsers/chromium'`).
- Run a full click-sweep of every nav page's `button[onclick]` and confirm
  zero `pageerror`s and no `onclick` handler references a function that
  doesn't exist on `window`.
- For any change touching `MASTER_USERS`/`ATTENDANCE`/evaluation data,
  write a targeted test that adds/imports data through the real UI flow
  (not by mutating the array directly) and asserts the displayed values
  match the real source of truth.
- Commit to the feature branch, merge fast-forward into `main`, push both.
